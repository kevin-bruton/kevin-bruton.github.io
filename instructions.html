In the VPS control panel, select rescue system - > Debian - Live
The VPS will reboot into the rescue mode
Connect to the VPS via VNC
Once connected, open a terminal and write:
sudo su
nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Add this as new content to that file and save and exit:

apt update
apt upgrade -y
apt install gparted filezilla grub2 wimtools -y
gparted

in the GParted partition editor graphical interface, delete all existing partitions and then create two new ones, each of 25000 mgs, and leave the rest of the space as unallocated space. Set the type of file system to ntfs then apply the changes and exit to the terminal
gdisk /dev/sda

This terminal utility accepts commands. Run the corresponding commands sequentially: “r”, “g”, “p”, “w”, “y”
After that, run:
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd
mkdir windisk
mount /dev/sda2 windisk
grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda

Open the grub configuration file with
nano grub.cfg

Insert this configuration in the file:
menuentry "windows installer" {
insmod ntfs
search --set=root --file=/bootmgr
ntldr /bootmgr
boot
}

Save the file then change directory:
cd /root/windisk

Create a new directory inside the windisk directory:
mkdir winfile
	
Download the windows ISO file:
wget -O win10.iso https://auto.sensibleinvesting.com.au/Win10.iso

Mount and copy the ISO:
mount -o loop win10.iso winfile
rsync -avz --progress winfile/* /mnt
umount winfile

Download Virtio Drivers
wget -O virtio.iso https://bit.ly/tsvirtio
mount -o loop virtio.iso winfile
mkdir /mnt/sources/virtio
rsync -avz --progress winfile/* /mnt/sources/virtio
cd /mnt/sources
touch cmd.txt
echo 'add virtio /virtio_drivers' >> cmd.txt
Wimlib-imagex update boot.wim 2 < cmd.txt
